## overview

Automated, pre-built, (potentially) pre-release packages for Wayland (sway/wlroots) tools for NixOS (**nixos-unstable** channel).

These packages are auto-updated to the latest version available from their upstream source control. This means this overlay and package
set will often contain **unreleased** versions.

Community chat is on Matrix: [#nixpkgs-wayland:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#nixpkgs-wayland:matrix.org). We are not on Libera.

## Usage

### Binary Cache

The [Cachix landing page for `nixpkgs-wayland`](https://nixpkgs-wayland.cachix.org) shows how to utilize the binary cache.

Packages from this overlay are regularly built against `nixos-unstable` and pushed to this cache.

### Continuous Integration

We have multiple CI jobs:
1. Update - this tries to advance nixpkgs and upgrade all packages. If it can successfully build them, the updates are push to master.
2. Advance - this tries to advance nixpkgs without touching the packages. This can help show when nixpkgs upgrades via `nixos-unstable` has advanced
   into a state where we are broken building against it.
3. Build - this just proves that `master` was working against `nixos-unstable` at the point in time captured by whatever is in `flake.lock` on `master`.

We don't have CI on Pull Requests, but I keep an eye on it after merging external contributions.

### Flake Usage

- Build and run [the Wayland-fixed up](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/pull/2484) version of [OBS-Studio](https://obsproject.com/):
  ```
  nix shell "github:nix-community/nixpkgs-wayland#obs-studio" --command obs
  ```
- Build and run `waybar`:
  ```
  nix run "github:nix-community/nixpkgs-wayland#waybar"
  ```

* Use as an overlay or package set via flakes:

  ```nix
  {
    # ...
    inputs = {
      # ...
      nixpkgs-wayland  = { url = "github:nix-community/nixpkgs-wayland"; };

      # only needed if you use as a package set:
      nixpkgs-wayland.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "cmpkgs";
      nixpkgs-wayland.inputs.master.follows = "master";
    };

    outputs = inputs: {
      nixosConfigurations."my-laptop-hostname" =
      let system = "x86_64-linux";
      in nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
        inherit system;
        modules = [({pkgs, config, ... }: {
          config = {
            nix = {
              # add binary caches
              binaryCachePublicKeys = [
                "cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY="
                "nixpkgs-wayland.cachix.org-1:3lwxaILxMRkVhehr5StQprHdEo4IrE8sRho9R9HOLYA="
                # ...
              ];
              binaryCaches = [
                "https://cache.nixos.org"
                "https://nixpkgs-wayland.cachix.org"
                # ...
              ];
            };

            # use it as an overlay
            nixpkgs.overlays = [ inputs.nixpkgs-wayland.overlay ];

            # or, pull specific packages (built against inputs.nixpkgs, usually `nixos-unstable`)
            environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
              inputs.nixpkgs-wayland.packages.${system}.waybar
            ];
          };
        })];
      };
    };
  }
  ```

### Install for NixOS (non-flakes, manual import)

If you are not using Flakes, then consult the [NixOS Wiki page on Overlays](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Overlays). Also, you can expand this section for a more literal, direct example. If you do pin, use a tool like `niv` to do the pinning so that you don't forget and wind up stuck on an old version.

<details>

```nix
{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:
let
  rev = "master"; # 'rev' could be a git rev, to pin the overlay.
  url = "https://github.com/nix-community/nixpkgs-wayland/archive/${rev}.tar.gz";
  waylandOverlay = (import "${builtins.fetchTarball url}/overlay.nix");
in
  {
    nixpkgs.overlays = [ waylandOverlay ];
    environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ wayvnc ];
    # ...
  }
```

You could write that to a file `./wayland.nix` next to your `configuration.nix` and then use it like so:

```nix
{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:
  {
    # ...
    imports = [
      # ...
      ./wayland.nix
    ];
  }
```

### Install for non-NixOS users

Non-NixOS users have many options, but here are two explicitly:

1. Activate flakes mode, then just run them outright like the first example in this README.

2. See the following details block for an example of how to add `nixpkgs-wayland` as a user-level
   overlay and then install a package with `nix-env`.

<details>

1. There are two ways to activate an overlay for just your user:

   1. Add a new entry in ``~/.config/nixpkgs/overlays.nix`:
    ```nix
    let
      url = "https://github.com/nix-community/nixpkgs-wayland/archive/master.tar.gz";
    in
    [
      (import "${builtins.fetchTarball url}/overlay.nix")
    ]
    ```

   2. Add a new file under a dir, `~/.config/nixpkgs/overlays/nixpkgs-wayland.nix`:
    ```nix
    let
      url = "https://github.com/nix-community/nixpkgs-wayland/archive/master.tar.gz";
    in
      (import "${builtins.fetchTarball url}/overlay.nix")
    ```

  Note, this method does not pin `nixpkgs-wayland`. That's left to the reader. (Just use flakes...)

2. Then, `nix-env` will have access to the packages:

```nix
nix-env -iA neatvnc
```

## Tips

#### General

- I recommend using [`home-manager`](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager/)!
- It has modules and options for:
  - `sway`
  - `waybar`
  - `obs` and plugins!
  - more!

#### `sway`

- You will likely want a default config file to place at `$HOME/.config/sway/config`. You can use the upstream default as a starting point: https://github.com/swaywm/sway/blob/master/config.in
- If you start `sway` from a raw TTY, make sure you use `exec sway` so that if sway crashes, an unlocked TTY is not exposed.

#### Nvidia Users

- Everything should just work now (aka, wlroots/sway don't need patching).
- This is a known-good working config, at least at one point in time:
  [mixins/nvidia.nix@ccd992](https://github.com/cole-mickens/nixcfg/blob/cdd9929d5d36ce5b4d64cf80bdeb1df3f2cba332/mixins/nvidia.nix)

## Development Guide

- Use `nix develop`
- `./main.nu`:
  - `./main.nu build` - builds and caches derivations that don't exist in the cache, use `nix-eval-jobs`
  - `./main.nu advance` - advances the flake inputs, runs `main build`
  - `./main.nu update` - advances the flake inputs, updates pkg revs, runs `main build`
- `build` pushes to the `nixpkgs-wayland` cachix

If for some reason the overlay isn't progressing and you want to help,
just clone the repo, run `nix develop -c ./main.nu update`
